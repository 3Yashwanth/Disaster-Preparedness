# Disaster-Preparedness

Problem Statement

"Lack of Immediate Guidance During Earthquakes in Schools"
Earthquakes often strike without warning, and while adults may understand basic safety protocols, many school students are unprepared and panic in such situations. Current disaster management systems in schools are often manual and dependent on teachers or administrators, leading to delays in action, confusion, and increased risk of injuries.
Existing Solutions
Earthquake Drills:
Schools conduct periodic drills to prepare students, but these are infrequent and often forgotten in real situations.
Alarm Systems:
Simple alarm systems alert occupants of an earthquake, but they do not provide specific instructions or adapt to the situation.
Mobile Applications:
Earthquake apps like MyShake or QuakeFeed provide alerts and safety tips, but they rely on smartphones, which are not always accessible to students in schools.
Manual Announcements:
Teachers or administrators may use PA systems to give instructions, but this depends on human availability and presence of mind, which might fail under stress.
Proposed Solution
Automated Earthquake Guidance System (AEGS)
A pre-installed software integrated into projectors, mics, and PA systems in schools that automatically activates when an earthquake occurs. It provides real-time instructions tailored for students and teachers, ensuring immediate and effective response.






Problem Statement

Efficient and Real-Time Management of Landslide and Road Blockage Alerts for Mountainous and High-Risk Areas"
Challenges
Delayed Awareness: Travelers are often unaware of landslides or road blockages until they encounter them, leading to accidents or traffic congestion.
Lack of Reporting Systems: Emergency road issues are often not reported in real time.
Inadequate Alternative Routes: Travelers lack immediate guidance on alternate routes, increasing risks and delays.
Manual Interventions: Current reporting systems (if any) require manual processes that delay information dissemination.
Existing Solutions
Traffic Management Apps (e.g., Google Maps, Waze): Provide general traffic updates but often rely on automated algorithms or manual user reports, which can be delayed.
Dedicated Disaster Alert Systems: Focus on large-scale disasters like earthquakes but often miss localized road-related issues.
News Channels or Websites: Provide updates but lack real-time, location-specific notifications and navigation support.
Proposed Solution
Landslide and Road Alert System (LRAS)
A community-driven, AI-powered mobile app integrated with Google Maps and other navigation systems to provide real-time updates on landslides, road blockages, or dangerous conditions.
